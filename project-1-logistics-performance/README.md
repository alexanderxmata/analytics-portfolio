# Logistics Performance & On-Time Delivery Analysis

## Business Problem
Logistics leadership lacked visibility into on-time delivery performance and carrier service reliability, making it difficult to identify delays and optimize shipping costs.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Power BI
- Excel

## Data
Simulated shipment-level logistics data including carriers, regions, delivery dates, distance, and shipping cost.

## Analysis Summary
- Calculated on-time delivery percentages, lead times, and cost per mile
- Identified underperforming carriers and regional delay hotspots
- Analyzed tradeoffs between cost and service level

## Key Insights
- Certain carriers consistently underperformed on on-time delivery
- Specific origin-destination lanes showed elevated delays
- Lower-cost carriers did not always provide better service

## Recommendations
- Reallocate volume away from underperforming carriers
- Address delay-prone lanes through routing adjustments
- Incorporate cost-per-mile metrics into carrier negotiations
