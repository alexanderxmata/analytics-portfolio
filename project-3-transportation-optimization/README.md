# Transportation Cost & Route Optimization

## Business Problem
Transportation leadership lacked visibility into high-cost routes and opportunities for shipment consolidation, leading to avoidable shipping expenses and inefficient carrier usage.

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Excel
- Power BI

## Data
Simulated route-level transportation data including origin, destination, carrier, units shipped, shipment cost, and shipment dates.

## Analysis Summary
- Analyzed route-level shipment cost, frequency, and units shipped using SQL
- Identified consolidation opportunities for high-frequency, low-volume routes
- Built Excel models to simulate shipment consolidation scenarios and estimate potential cost savings
- Developed Power BI dashboards to visualize cost drivers, route efficiency, and modeled savings

## Key Insights
- Certain high-frequency routes were driving disproportionately high transportation costs
- Low-volume shipments on select routes presented opportunities for consolidation
- Modeled scenario analysis showed meaningful potential cost savings without impacting service levels

## Recommendations
- Consolidate shipments on low-volume, high-frequency routes
- Reallocate volume to more cost-efficient carriers where feasible
- Monitor top cost-driving routes through Power BI dashboards to continuously optimize transportation spend
